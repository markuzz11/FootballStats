# Football Stats

**Visualization and computation of football metrics**

---

### Description
This project was initiated due to my interest in football and its analytics. Here, I attempt to modify and, to some extent, automate simple examples for calculating and visualizing certain football metrics.

The main library used is mplsoccer, which contains a table with open data from StatsBomb for matches and competitions via the Sbopen() method and the ability to visualize using Pitch() or VerticalPitch().

Here are some statistical data of player Neymar Jr. and PSG team in the French league for the 2022/2023 season.

### Installation:
If you are running the project on your own machine, execute:
1. `pip install requirements.txt`
If you are running the project in Google Colab, execute:
1. `!pip install requirements.txt`

### Usage:
To use your own data, you can make changes to variables.py, after familiarizing yourself with finder.ipynb, where the process of finding initial data is presented.
